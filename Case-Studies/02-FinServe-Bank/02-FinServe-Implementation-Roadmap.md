## RISK & MITIGATION

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
|---|---|
| **Automation approves bad loans** | Keep 20% manual review; validate model with historical data first |
| **System uptime issues during migration** | Staged rollout (10%→50%→100%); rollback plan ready |
| **SEBI compliance violation** | Regulatory audit at end of each phase; compliance team involvement |
| **Staff resistance** | Communication: "reskilling" not "layoffs"; offer video KYC roles |
| **API integration delays** | Engage with CIBIL/Account Aggregator vendors early (M1) |
| **CTO resource constraint** | Hire contractors if needed; prioritize Phase 1 over new features |
