## STAKEHOLDER CONFLICT ANALYSIS & RESOLUTION

### **Conflict #1: CEO vs CTO on Timeline**

**CEO's Position:**
- "We need results NOW. Competitors are stealing market share."
- "I want all 3 phases done in 2 months max."

**CTO's Position:**
- "Quick fixes will destabilize the platform. We need proper testing."
- "Phase 1 needs 2 weeks, Phase 2 needs 4 weeks. Realistic timeline: 6 weeks."

**Your Resolution Strategy:**

> **For CEO:**
> "I understand the urgency. Here's our phased approach:
> - **Week 1-2:** Quick wins live (shipping display, exit-intent popup) → Immediate ₹34 lakhs recovery
> - **Week 3-6:** Mobile optimization → Additional ₹30-40 lakhs
> - **Total impact by Week 6: ₹64-74 lakhs recovery**
> 
> This gives you visible wins in 2 weeks AND proper stability by Week 6. We prove ROI quickly, then scale."

> **For CTO:**
> "I know you want stability. We're not rushing—we're prioritizing.
> - Week 1-2: Low-risk changes (UI only, no backend touching) = low risk
> - Week 3-6: Structured development with proper testing
> - You control the quality gates."

---

### **Conflict #2: Marketing vs UI/UX (Blame-shifting)**

**Marketing's Position:**
- "The UI is too complex. That's why users abandon. It's a UX problem."

**UI/UX's Position:**
- "Users abandon because of hidden charges and slow payment. Not our fault. It's a product/backend problem."

**Your Resolution Strategy:**

> **Data-based Response:**
> "Let's not blame each other. The data shows:
> - 35% of users cite unexpected charges (not UX) → Shipping display fixes this
> - 28% cite slow execution (not UX) → Backend optimization fixes this
> - 18% cite poor UI (UX is a factor, but not #1)
> 
> **Phase 1 focus: Shipping display + payment speed** (biggest impact)
> **Phase 2 focus: Mobile UI improvement** (after foundation is solid)
> 
> This approach addresses all issues in priority order."

---

### **Conflict #3: CFO vs All (Budget Constraints)**

**CFO's Position:**
- "You want to spend ₹27 lakhs? Show me ROI first. I need proof of concept."
- "I'll only approve ₹8 lakhs for Phase 1 pilot. Prove it works, then we invest in Phase 2."

**Your Resolution Strategy:**

> **Phased Budget Approach:**
> 
> **Phase 1 Budget: ₹8 lakhs**
> - Shipping display: ₹2 lakhs
> - Exit-intent popup: ₹1.5 lakhs
> - WhatsApp integration: ₹3 lakhs
> - Testing & deployment: ₹1.5 lakhs
> 
> **Phase 1 Expected Return: ₹34 lakhs/month**
> **Phase 1 ROI: 4,150% (one-time spend, recurring return)**
> 
> "Once Phase 1 proves ROI in Week 2, we'll have budget approval for Phase 2. This de-risks the investment for you."
